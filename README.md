The dataset used in this project was taken from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data.
# Accuracy 
also the accuracy of the model varies each time you train it from 70 to 90 perfect reson being it was only trained using RandomForestClassifier.
you can try applying verious other models for better accuracy or do feature scaling or feature engineering
